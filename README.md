**Database Project - Club for Billiards Lovers**

This university project, titled "Club for Billiards Lovers" involves the design and implementation of a relational database system. The project was structured into several stages to ensure a comprehensive approach to database development:

`Conceptual Schema`: Designed the high-level structure of the database, identifying the main entities and their relationships to capture key information about clubs, members, and services.

`Relational Schema`: Translated the conceptual design into a relational model, defining the specific tables, columns, and relationships required for implementation.

`Create Script`: Authored SQL scripts to build the database structure, including tables, constraints (such as primary and foreign keys), data types, and indexes to enforce data integrity.

`Insert Script`: Created SQL INSERT statements to populate the database with initial data, ensuring it is functional and ready for testing.

Queries in `Relational Algebra (RA)` and `SQL`: Developed specific queries to validate the database design and test functionality through real-world data requests.

**Repository Structure**

The following files in this repository represent each stage of the project:

Conceptual_Schema.jpg: Image showing the high-level design of the database structure.
Description.md: Detailed description of the project's purpose and goals.
Discussion_of_Loops.md: Documentation discussing loops identified in the database schema and the solutions implemented.
Relational_Schema.png: Diagram of the relational schema illustrating tables and relationships.
SQL.pdf: Documentation and query examples used for validating the database through SQL.
create_script: SQL file containing commands to create the database structure.
insert_script: SQL file containing data insertion statements for initial data population.


This structure outlines a complete end-to-end workflow of the database project. Each file corresponds to a specific phase of the development process, from initial design to population and testing.
